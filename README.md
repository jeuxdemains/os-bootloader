# os-bootloader
This is my bootloader coded in pure asm.
You can use one of the flp files as a bootable floppy disk for a virtual machine in order to test it.
You can compile it with nasm or tasm (probably masm would work as well).

Comments are available on every line so there should be nothing misterious in the code.
