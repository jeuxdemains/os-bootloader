# os-bootloader
This is my bootloader coded in pure asm.
You can use one of the flp files to make a bootable floppy disk (the easiest way is with virutal machine).
You can compile it with nasm or tasm (probably masm would work as well).

Comments are available on every line so there should be nothing misterious in the code.
